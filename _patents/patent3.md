Controlling a valveless microfluidic device using rotational and pistoning motion is disclosed. A system embodiment includes, but is not limited to, a stage to support a valveless microfluidic device, the stage having a bottom surface coupled with an extension, having a threaded portion, and defining an interior volume; a first motor including a powered rotating portion operable to engage with the threaded portion to induce a z-axis motion of the stage; a second motor including a powered rotating portion coupled with a slidable coupler, the slidable coupler engaging the interior volume to induce a second motion of the stage about the z-axis; a base defining an aperture to receive the stage; and a lid having a subset of the plurality of apertures corresponding to a subset of a plurality of apertures defined by the valveless microfluidic device upon positioning of the stage by the first motor and the second motor.
