Work experience
======
* Global Health Labs (spun out from Global Good)
  * Senior Research Engineer, Research Engineer,	2020 - present
  * Led cross functional team to develop portable medication adherence monitor with LTE telemetry & dashboard through clinical trials in India and Uganda. Included ideation, feedback studies, prototyping, fielding and data analysis.  
  * Produced vacuum chuck heater testbeds for development of an in-house diagnostic test, greatly increasing throughput and enabling mapping of parameter space for optimization.  
  * Built QC test device to evaluate heat leak after vacuum sealing dewars, firmware programming in C. Used for factory process checks by our manufacturing partner.
  * Implemented more accurate test protocol that resulted in 10% measured performance increase.  
  * Wrote user-friendly environmental chamber and DAQ LabVIEW controller for multiparameter control and measurement, combined camera and data logging tool, prototype hardware controls, data processing, and image capture and processing for analysis of visual data, firmware in C.
  * Organized lab recapitalization with new equipment, improved layout and mobile lab benches to quickly scale experimental setups as needed, passed ISO9001 audit; supervisor for lab tech and interns.

* Intellectual Ventures Laboratory - Global Good
* Research Engineer, Associate Research Engineer	2015 - 2020
  * Collaborated with microfluidic experts for a novel valveless fluidic interface with test device laminate, single photon counting with photomultiplier tube (PMT) to assess E.coli contamination in water samples significantly faster than standard culture techniques.
  * Developed solar direct drive add-on cooler to existing product (Arktek Passive Vaccine Storage Device) for indefinite cold storage with solar panel only. Retrofit kit designed for blind installation.
  * Designed and built a phase change material (PCM) based culture incubator capable of surviving power outages for use in unreliable power settings. Used Comsol and Abaqus for thermal modelling.

* Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company
* Mechanical Engineer Sr., Test Engineer, Systems Engineer Asc.	2006- 2015
* Designed concepts and detailed models for a satellite payload incorporating levied requirements and satisfied requests from a multidisciplinary team. Produced detailed drawings incorporating GD&T.
* Performed stress, frequency and thermal analysis in Abaqus FEA for preliminary sizing.
* Design experience including composites, exotic materials (tungsten, beryllium, molybdenum, others)
* Vacuum chamber design and operation, space environments data analysis in Matlab.
* Packaged optical components and mechanisms for precision pointing in space constrained locations.
* Performed system level vehicle and payload development testing as a Certified Test Conductor. Developed Perl and Matlab software to streamline realtime testing.
* Operated multiple space vehicles and ground control systems on a 24x7 basis.
* Security clearance: Top Secret / SCI with SSBI (last active 2015)
